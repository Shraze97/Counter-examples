# Counter-examples in Topology

The main goal of this project is to formalize Counter-examples in Topology and prove specific properties of Counter-Examples in Topology. The current Subgoal is to formalize specific topologies that satisfy certain Separation Axioms under the Kolmogorov Classification. So, The main Topologies we need to formalize are:-
